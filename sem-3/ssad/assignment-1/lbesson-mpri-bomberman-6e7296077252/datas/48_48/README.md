===========================

 Here are stored **all the pictures used for the game**.
 Those *png* pictures are used by the *client*, to build a *GUI* with *PyGame*.
 
 The *GUI* can be disable with the *--nowindow* option, or you can force to try to launch it with the *--window* option.
 The game should run without any additionnal window. But maybe it require an *X server* anyway.
